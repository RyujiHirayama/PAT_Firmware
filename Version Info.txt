Please make sure to use the latest version of the firmware. The latest software might not support older firmware.

V1.0: The FPGA code for the first version of the acoustophoretic control board (Rev.1: ID C1-C9), make sure not the array ID. 
V2.0: The FPGA code for the second version of the acoustophoretic control board (Rev.2,3,4: ID C10-?).
      Changed the pin mapping of the FPGA:
            SyncMasterSelect: B5 -> F2; SyncMain: A15 -> T14; USB_DATA[7]: E10 -> B5;
V2.1: Added the reference 40kHz signal to the D14 pin.

V3.2.X:	In this new FPGA code, a FIFO buffer has been implemented as a cushion.
	This makes sure that the board updates at an exact rate and improves the maximum acceleration in vertical direction.
	Also, a function to adjust the update rate using a divider has been added (e.g. 10kHz when the divider is 4).
	The old function to control the boards in the MATD mode has been removed.
	Note that v3.2.1 is for the old boards (Rev.1: ID C1-9) and v3.2.2 is for the new control boards (Rev.2,3,4: ID C10-?).
V3.3.X:	Minor bugs were fixed in this version. 
	The colour buffer was not working properly in the previous version (3.2.X) but it's now working.
	The version v3.3.1 is for the old control boards (Rev.1: ID C1-9) and v3.3.2 is for the new control ones (Rev.2,3,4: ID C10-?).
	If you check the control board and there is no REF pin, it's an old control board.
V3.4.X: In this minor fixed version, the FIFO for the messages will be reset if no data is input for a second.
